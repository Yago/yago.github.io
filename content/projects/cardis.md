With its new website entirely design and developed by [Antistatique](https://antistatique.net), Cardis needs also and completely new search engine for it properties across Switzerland. We choose and implement it using React and Redux combined with Leaflet map engine. It must handle hand draw search, multiple advanced filters and map movements filtering.

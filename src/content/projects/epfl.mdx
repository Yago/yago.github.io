Almost as famous as the MIT, the EPFL needs a complete redesign for all its websites. [Antistatique](https://antistatique.net) provide this new design, and also the web styleguide who came with it. It's a huge documentation of all the UI components, the display modes and some example page for the internal teams who are going to work on the new web infrastructure.

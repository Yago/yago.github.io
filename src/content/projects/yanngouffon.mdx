Aside from my developer work, I'm also a passionate photographer. Previously, my photographs was on this very same website, but this wasn't making a lot of sense. So I develop a dedicated website to give it more space and freedom. I use Astro, Tailwind and Photoswipe to build this new static and performant website.

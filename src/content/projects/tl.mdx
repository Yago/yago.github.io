The public transport of Lausanne (TL) is a major actor in the mobility of the city. The website is a key tool for the users to plan their trips, check the schedules and get information about the network. The website is also a major tool for the company to communicate with the users and provide them with the latest news and updates. I worked on the design system and on the Wordpress behind the new website.

We were mandated to develop a new shop for the physical maps of SwissTopo, the Swiss Federal Office of Topography and with no doubt, the greatest cartographers in the world. Based on Drupal Commerce, I worked on the Twig theme part. Funny story, we are using the [Styleguide](/projects/admin) we made for the Government 7 years sooner.

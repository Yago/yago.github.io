The city of Vevey, located in the coastline of the Leman, needs a new website to better inform its citizen. Based on **Drupal 8**, I worked on the atomic styleguide and the theme creation. The main focus with a website like this one is the **accessibility** to provide a quick and easy access to the information for any kind of user profile.

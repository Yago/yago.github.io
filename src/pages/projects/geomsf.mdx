In collaboration with GIS specialists [INSER](https://www.inser.ch/), Antistatique did all the UX and UI design. I work on the team that integrates the design in the final product using Angular and Tailwind. The main focus was to deliver a set of very flexible visual components with sufficient settings and events API.

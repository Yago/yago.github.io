Four years after the last redesign, it was already the time for Cardis to rethink its website to stay in front of the Swiss real estate scene. After a fresh and modern new design, we code this new platform from scratch using a decoupled architecture based on **Drupal** and **NextJS**. With this very flexible stack, we have been hable to offer a fluid and performant experience and a complete new search engine.

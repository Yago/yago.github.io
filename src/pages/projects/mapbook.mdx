I always loved working with maps and GIS solutions, but I'm not very convinced by the existing map managers that you can find online. So I made my own Map application blueprint based on the finest technologies on the market : [React](http://reactjs.org/) as the UI library and 
[Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/) as the WebGL Map engine with GeoJSON support out of the box. I also use [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) to offer an easy and light data management.

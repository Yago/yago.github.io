When your JavaScript application gets bigger, **you’ll quickly need something like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to distribute data across your application and your components**.  With Redux or any kind of state management library, the idea is to trigger some actions with a *payload*, which will themselves alter the global data storage of the app using this portion of new data.

It’s fairly easy to setup when you deal with simple data structure.  **For example**, if you want to update your `content` at your Store’s root, you can do something like:

```js
const reducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  if (action.type === "ALTER_STORE") {
    return {
      ...state,
      content: action.payload
    };
  }
  return state;
};
```

But when you’re starting to have a more complex data structure with nested objects and arrays, things became quickly tricky and after the Callbacks and the Promises of Hell, please welcome the “*Reducer of Hell*” (thanks to Object Spread goodness)! 

**For example** if your want to update a specific post’s `content` attribute:
```js
const complexDefaultState = {
  contents: {
    post: [
      { id: 0, type: "post", content: "First article" },
      { id: 1, type: "post", content: "Second article" },
      { id: 2, type: "post", content: "Third article" }
    ],
    page: []
  }
};

const reducer = (state = complexDefaultState, action) => {
  if (action.type === "ALTER_STORE") {
    return {
      ...state,
      contents: {
        ...state.contents,
        [action.payload.type]: [
          ...state.contents[action.payload.type].slice(0, action.payload.id),
          {
            ...state.contents[action.payload.type][action.payload.id],
            ...action.payload
          },
          ...state.contents[action.payload.type].slice(action.payload.id + 1)
        ]
      }
    };
  }
  return state;
};
```

Dirty, right? Ok, maybe you can be smarter and start modeling something more decoupled and less nested, or maybe not… Thankfully, **Michel Weststrate**, the smart guy behind [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx), had provided us a more elegant solution for making state mutations: [Immer.js](https://github.com/mweststrate/immer)!

You simply have to wrap your reducer inside the `immer` method and replace your dirty mutation code by a more elegant one, same as native `Array`  and `Object` prototype methods.

**For the same complex example** using Immer, your reducer will look like:

```js
import p from "immer";

const complexDefaultState = {/* see previous example */};

const reducer = p((state = complexDefaultState, action) => {
  if (action.type === "ALTER_STORE") {
    state.contents[action.payload.type][action.payload.id].content =
      action.payload.content;
  }
  return state;
});
```

Holy cow! Yep, my first reaction too. **Now you can handle complex Store data without having dirty reducers**. Complex data; clean, typed and performant reducers, what else?

I invite you to read all the good stuff of Immer.js on it [repository](https://github.com/mweststrate/immer). There is a great and visual explanation of how it works under the hood and what are all the benefits of using it (aside of reducing your code size by 1,000).
